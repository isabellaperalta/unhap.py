# unhap.py

When run, this Python code generates and displays a different response letter every minute. All generated letters have a common skeleton that defines their basic structure. There are also dynamic sections that change from one response letter to the next. The code is designed to randomly choose from multiple options for each of these sections, making it possible to create a total of 11,664 different response letters.
