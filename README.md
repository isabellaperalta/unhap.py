code that generates different love letters

When run, this Python code generates and displays a different response letter every minute.
All generated letters have a common skeleton that defines their common basic structure.
There are also dynamic sections that change from one response letter to the next.
The code is designed to randomly choose out of multiple options for each of these sections,
making it possible to create 11,664 different response letters.
